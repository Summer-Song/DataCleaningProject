## First load the data into R with corresponding column names. The first column is the subject ID, and the last column is the activity they are doing. 
## Merging the training dataset and test dataset
## "com_data" contains the complete dataset without any other aggregation

## The "new_data" contains attibutes subject ID, and mean and standard deviation of the following measurements:
## tBodyAcc-XYZ
## tGravityAcc-XYZ
## tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
## tBodyGyro-XYZ
## tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
## tBodyAccMag
## tGravityAccMag
## tBodyAccJerkMag
## tBodyGyroMag
## tBodyGyroJerkMag
## fBodyAcc-XYZ
## fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
## fBodyGyro-XYZ
## fBodyAccMag
## fBodyAccJerkMag
## fBodyGyroMag
## fBodyGyroJerkMag

## "new_data2" is as required as the project, aggregate the dataset "new_data" into another form by their subject ID and activity.
